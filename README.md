# lon-stack-dx
The LON Stack DX enables developers to build networks of communicating devices, as part of the Industrial Internet of Things, using any processor supporting the C programming language for connected devices. Devices with the LON Stack DX can exchange data with each other on an easy-to-use, publish-subscribe data model over IP or native LON channels. LON devices can collect data from physical sensors built to monitor things including temperature, humidity, light-level, power-consumption, or moisture, and make the data available to other LON devices in the same network. Using data received from other LON devices or local sensors, LON devices can also control physical actuators such as LED dimmers, motor controllers, damper controllers, and solenoids. The LON protocol is an open standard defined by the ISO/IEC 14908 series of standards.

A larger implementation of the LON stack is available in the LON Stack EX included with the IzoT SDK.  The LON Stack EX implements optional features of the LON protocol that are suitable for edge servers and workstations implementing the LON protocol.  The IzoT SDK with the LON Stack EX is available at http://iecdocs.renesas.com/display/DrftIzot/IzoT+SDK.
